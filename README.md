A simple repo storing animations I've created to visually present Computer Science related animations.

- `add-two-numbers`

    Presents two numbers stored in LinkedLists being added together and output in a LinkedList.
    
    Using elementary math and number carrying, this solution is quite fast and allows essentially infinitely
    large numbers to be added together without any problems.
